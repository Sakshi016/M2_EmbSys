# INTRODUCTION

Water Level Controller using Microcontroller will help in automatically controlling the water motor by sensing the water level in a tank.
The Water Level Sensing Section senses the level of water in the tank and sends it to the Receiver Section. Receiver Section is connected to the Controlling Section, which process the received information and produces visual, sound indications and controls the operation of the motor whenever required.

# FEATURES

* conserves water
* alerts are sent out as soon as the water level drops.
* saves pump life
* fully automatic
* indicates amount of water
* easy to use


# STATE OF ART AND RESEARCH

*  We need such devices in order to prevent the overflow of water from the tanks.
* detects zone of danger
* compact design
* feature touch keys

# SWOT ANALYSIS
 ## STRENGTH 

 * Cost efficient
 * regulates water flow and optimize water performance
 * Shows current water level

 ## WEAKNESS

 * no warranty or guarantee
 * may lead to burning due to lack of short circuit protection 

## OPPORTUNITY

* ease at manual work
* money and power saver

## THREATS

* wiring can occur any time

# 5W & 1H

## WHO
  
   - All the people be it for the domestic use or be it for industrial purpose.
   - Sewer services for office and apartment buildings.
   
## WHAT

   - Resulting into less manual work.


## WHERE
  
  - Hotels, home apartments,factories.
   
## WHY
   
   * Automatically supplies water to elevated tanks and buildings.
   * Outputting alarms for water shortage or water rise in elevated tanks.

## WHEN 

   * To ensure constant reserve of water in storage tank


# HOW

Automatic water level controller switch the motor on whenever the water level drops below a certain level and shuts the motor off when the water rises well above a fixed level.
